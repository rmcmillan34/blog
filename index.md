Hey, I'm Ryan (RizzSec), and welcome to my blog. Since you are reading this, thank you for stopping by. I am currently studying for a Masters of Cyber Security, specialising in Security Engineering through the University of New South Wales (UNSW). My ultimate goal is to transition my career from an Electronics Technician to becoming an offensive security professional.

I am keenly interested in cybersecurity, offensive security, software development, and machine learning/Artificial Intelligence.

In this blog, I will share the knowledge I have found particularly interesting or helpful during my studies. The aim of this blog is to improve my writing and showcase the skills I have gained throughout my cybersecurity journey.

I expect to utilize this platform to publish CTF/TryHackMe/HackTheBox write-ups, software and project tutorials for projects posted on my GitHub, and topical articles.

Once again, thanks for stopping by. I hope you learn something or, at the very least, are slightly entertained.
