Hey, I'm Ryan and welcome to my blog. Since you are reading this id like to say thank you for stopping by. I am Currently Studying a Bachelor of Artificial Intelligence minoring in Cyber Security through Deakin University. In this blog, I will do my best to share the knowledge that I have found interesting during my studies. 

The aim of this blog is to improve my writing and produce a body of works and hopefully display skills gained along the way.
I expect to publish CTF/TryHackMe writeups, software tutorials and topical articles.
