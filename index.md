title: Ryan's Cyber Security/Programming Blog
---

Hey, I'm Ryan, and welcome to my blog. Since you are reading this, I'd like to say thank you for stopping by. I am currently studying for a Masters of Cyber Security through UNSW. My goal is to transition my career into becoming an offensive security professional.

I have a keen interest in cybersecurity, offensive security, software development, and machine learning/AI.

In this blog, I will do my best to share the knowledge that I have found particularly interesting or helpful during my studies. The aim of this blog is to improve my writing and showcase the skills I have gained along the way.

I expect to utilize this platform to publish CTF/TryHackMe/HackTheBox write-ups, software and project tutorials for projects posted on my GitHub, and topical articles.

Once again, thanks for stopping by. I hope you learn something or, at the very least, are slightly entertained. If you would like to get in touch, please find me at the following:
